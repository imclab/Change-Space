h1. Change Space

h4. Navigate OSX Lion desktops as if they were a 2D grid of spaces

h2. The problem

In OSX Lion Apple dispensed with the simple and effective 2D spaces grids many people loved and relied on.

In its place, there is the more dynamic concept of 'Desktops', which can be created by the system on the fly, for instance when running a full screen app. Also, the system can re-order the desktops according to your use.

These features are of little use to power users, who know where their apps and windows are, and like to navigate fast between them. A common layout is a 3x3 grid - then from the central space you can reach 4 others with just one keypress. Very useful for flicking between your code editor, and the browser, and perhaps mail, or iTunes for instance.

h2. The solution

In Lion you can turn off the feature 'Automatically rearrange spaces based on the most recent use' in the Mission Control system preferences pane, and I recommend this. You can also make sure you have the right number of spaces (e.g. 9) by adding desktops using the left hand side + button when in Mission Control.

With 9 desktops set up and fixed, you can then assign your applications to them by dragging them to the right desktop and right clicking on the icon in the task bar, and choosing Options->Assign to this desktop.

Then the only problem remaining is how to navigate between the desktops as if they were in a grid, using the cursor keys.

This app attempts to solve that problem.

It is not entirely easy, because Mission Control is not scriptable. However, there is still a way to change between spaces, and to identify which space you are currently on.

h2. Installation

Download the app, and drag it into your Applications folder.  Then launch it as usual. If it works for you, you can safely add it to your launch items.

h2. Usage

Change Space has a preferences window, and here you should set the kind of grid you use. (2x2, 3x2, 4x2, or 3x3)

The keys to change spaces are ctrl-shift arrow keys.

When you first change space, the program will run through all your desktops so it can identify them all.

h2. Known issues

Change Space cannot change to desktop 1 without sending ctrl-1 to the system. Unfortunately this doesn't when if you are holding the shift key down at the time. So sometimes if you do not release the shift key in time this does not work.

The timing of the dissappearance of the space number in the status bar should be fixed to be 2.5 seconds after the most recent desktop change.
